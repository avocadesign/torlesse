torlesse-wp
===========

A Genesis child theme with SASS based grid and entypo icons.

The Torlesse range of mountains is found in Cantebury, New Zealand. This theme is meant to provide a solid base for further development. We felt it was an appropriate name for it. 

This project is intended to be a foundation for a clean lightweight Genesis theme for wordpress that uses a responsive mobile first approach to layout. The Susy grid enables layout to be created with mixins so that the html can remain untouched and layout and breakpoints can easily be adjusted in the SASS files. 

The same approach is taken with the font icons. Using the mixin library created by rstacruz we can load only the relivant CSS for the icons we are actually using.


**This project makes use of:**
