Torlesse is a child theme for Genesis 2.0 

Based on SASS, SUSY repsonsive grid and some basic styling. 



Based on:

Bones for Genesis 2.0
==============

My fork of [eddiemachado's](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones-genesis) Bones for Genesis. Built for Genesis 2.0+ and WordPress 3.5+.

A starting point for new Genesis projects. This is a starter child theme, not a dependency. Clone it. Fork it. Hack it for your own projects. Build cool things on the web.

## Changelog
### 2.0.6 (July 20, 2013)
- `bfg_load_scripts` doesn't need to be called with priority `999`

- '[Better Helvetica](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/better-helvetica/)' starter sans-serif font stack
- Buttons should have base `line-height: 1`
- Added WooCommerce theme support declaration (disabled by default)
- jQuery version bump

### 2.0.5 (July 16, 2013)
- For `comment-reply` script loading, changed `is_singular()` to `is_single() || is_page() || is_attachment()` in `bfg_load_stylesheets()` for better granularity
- Added function in `search.php` to redirect directly to the result on searches with only one result (disabled by default)
- Title links should typically inherit their `.entry-title` color, not show the default link color
- Added filters in `post.php` to customize the older/newer post navigation text (disabled by default)
- `Readme.md` updates

### 2.0.4 (July 10, 2013)
- Removed `genesis_footer_backtotop_text` filter, since it's deprecated in Genesis 2.0 with HTML5
- Added support for better favicon display
- `g_ent` is deprecated in Genesis 2.0. Switched to `html_entity_decode`, with better characters for post prev/next navigation
- Styled `pre` like `blockquote` in `_print.scss`
- Added a button click effect extend in `_toolkit.scss`
- IE image height correction

### 2.0.3 (July 4, 2013)
- Better input skeleton styles
- Added a starter breakpoint mixin
- Normalize.scss submodule update

### 2.0.2 (June 28, 2013)
- Removed page-templates folder. Templates should be in the child theme root, to properly overwrite the Genesis parent templates.
- Gave `input[type="search"]` explicit box-sizing.

- Added child theme definitions (`CHILD_THEME_NAME`, `CHILD_THEME_URL`, `CHILD_THEME_VERSION`)
- Commented out `text-shadow: none;` from `::selection`, since this prevents all selection styling unless `background-color` is also specified 
- Removed `_grid.scss` responsive styling, since it was causing awkward breakpoint issues on non-responsive sites.
- Commented out `body { text-rendering:  optimizeLegibility; }`, since this can cause display issues on poorly generated fonts.

- Added skeleton selectors for more HTML5 input types
